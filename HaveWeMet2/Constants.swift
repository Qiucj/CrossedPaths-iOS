All data is stored locally on your phone. No one, not even other apps on your phone, can access it. Sharing data with any group administrator is voluntary.  It is your responsibility to read the privacy policy of that group which is provided everytime when you send data.\n\n2. You have complete control over when to collect data. Data is automatically deleted after a week. You can delete all data at any time.\n\n3. The digital signature of your location history instead of your actual location history is stored locally on your phone. These signatures cannot be traced back to origin location and time and can only be compared to on another to check if they match.\n\n4. Decentralized model lets your phone download the database and compare on the phone. No one else knows your overlap results.\n\n5. Only digital signatures of timestamped locations that fit the group adminstrator's description are sent to that administrator.  We require the administrator clearly specify the specific locations and times that they collect in their privacy policy.  Through programming, we implement these exact descriptions\n\n6. If you still have reservations on data privacy, a path you can take is to start updating location only when you anticipate meeting group members that do not live with you, such as going to work or out shopping. At other times, you can turn off the location updates.\n\n7. You are not allowed to share your digital signatures collected following one group's description to another group, so you will not accidentally share data to the wrong group.\n\n8. In rare occasions, we or a third party working with us may ask you to voluntarily share all your digital signatures in the past 7 days.  More privacy protocols will be communicated to you at that time. A password will be provided to enable you to share those infomration if you choose."

    public static let privacyPolicy = "Effective as of July 18, 2020.\n\nEffective as of July 18, 2020. \"Privacy Policy\" describes the privacy practices of CrossedPaths Foundation (\"CrossedPaths,\" \"we,\" \"us,\" or \"our\") in connection with the CrossedPaths GPS mobile application (“app”). This Privacy Policy also describes the rights and choices available to individuals with respect to their information when using the app.\n\nABOUT CROSSED PATHS\n\nCrossedPaths GPS is an app that provides a platform for users to be voluntarily notified of important information based on their location history without sacrificing privacy for the ones who share the information.  For example, a store may want to unintrusilvely promote a product to all people who visited the stores in the recent past.  Another example is person A that visted a restaurant may like to be volunteerily contacted by person B who were close at the restaurant at the same time.  Our app provides a platform that may make such desires possible.\n\nHOW CROSSEDPATHS WORKS\n\nTimestamped location is always one-way hashed into a string that serves as the digital signature of that particular time-space before it is stored. \"One-way\" means that it's nearly impossible to derive the original text from the string, thus making it nearly impossible to reverse a digital signature to reveal the original time-space.  However, this signature can be used to compare to signuatures in another user's phone.  Equal signuatures indicate overlaps of time-space between the two devices. A user choose when to track the device's location using such digital signatures that become stored on the device for 7 days.  A copy of these data signatures that fit a group's location and time specification that the user wants to be associated with is also saved on the device for 7 days.  This copy can be later shared with the group's administrator at the user's discretion.  Working with us, a group administrator can setup a group specifying the time-space range of digital signatures that the group is interested.  Each group provides its own privacy policy specifying how they will use the collected data.  Users agreeing with a group's privacy policy can voluntarily send digital signatures that satisfy the group time-space specification to the group administrator.  After removing all identifiable information, the group administrator can publish the shared digital signaturs in an anonymous, aggregated, or de-identified data set where other users can download to compare to their digital signatures on their devices.  The only information can be derived for end-user is how many overlaps the device had with the data signatures in the data set.  No information about who, where, or how long each overlap lasts can be gained.  The group administrator can also show a specific message giving context to \"overlaps\" when an end user choose to download from the group's data set.  \n\nUSER RESPONSIBILITIES\n\nCrossedPaths GPS is designed to facilitate anonymous sharing of digital signatures of location history. As such, it is imperative that you: (i) comply with our terms of use; (ii) provide accurate information (including location data) when using the app; and (iii) make informed decisions about how you use CrossedPaths including a group's own privacy policy before your decision to share any digital signatures with that group's administrator.\n\nPERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT\n\nInformation you provide to us.\nThe personal information you provide to us through CrossedPaths GPS or otherwise may include:\n     •Your email address if you contact us through email, and any information you disclose in emails you sent us.\n      •We do not collect digital signatures of time stamped location from you.

For example, this may occur if a user met you and others that the user can be certain others did not share their digital signatures during the 7 days.\nProfessional advisors. If you conatact us other than to share digital signatures of your location history, we may disclose your personal information in those contacts to professional advisors, such as lawyers, auditors, and insurers, where necessary in the course of the professional services that they render to us.\nFor compliance, fraud prevention and safety.
